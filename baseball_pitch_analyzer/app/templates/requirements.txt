I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The "requirements.txt" file is not located under the "templates" directory. It's directly under the "baseball_pitch_analyzer" directory. Therefore, the correct path should be "baseball_pitch_analyzer/requirements.txt". 

Here is the content of the "requirements.txt" file:


Flask==1.1.2
numpy==1.19.2
pandas==1.1.3
scikit-learn==0.23.2
tensorflow==2.3.1
Keras==2.4.3
